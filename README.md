A project website for users to buy / sell used computer and console games. 

## Description

This project was a school assignment where I was supposed to create a website for users to buy and / sell used computer or console games. 
We were assigned assets like logo, name, slogan and images. I used an API from https://rawg.io/ instead, and fetched data there for game-content.

Website might be a bit slow to load in first time visiting when fetching data first time around, but give it a little time. Usually responds pretty quick after that.  

The website contains the following pages:

- Main page
- Product specific Page (when you click on a random game)
- Contact page
- About page
- Cart page
- Wishlist page
- Checkout page
- SignIn / SignUp page
- My account / User page
- Reset password page
- Store refound policy page
- Terms of service page

### Target audience was: 
Aged 18 to 25 who are interested in computer games, and would either like to purchase games or would like to sell games they have finished playing.

## Built With

This website was built using the following languages:

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Javascript 

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bLangved/Cross-course-remake.git
```

### Running

Contains some static files, but the user needs an API key to fetch the data from the database. Sign up to https://rawg.io/ to get one. 
- Update all API key-variables in js-files with your own API key. 

User might also get errors retrieving data without running through a CORS Proxy. 
- Update all proxy-variables in js-files with your own proxy.
